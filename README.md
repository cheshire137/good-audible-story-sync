# good-audible-story-sync

Script to sync your read books from Audible to Goodreads and StoryGraph.

## How to use

> [!NOTE]
> This is intended to be run from macOS.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cheshire137/good-audible-story-sync/releases/latest) of the gem. Install it via:

```sh
gem install good-audible-story-sync.gem
```

There should now be a `good-audible-story-sync` executable in your path. Run it via:

```sh
good-audible-story-sync
```

You will be prompted to log in to Audible and Storygraph. The tool saves your encrypted login
credentials in a SQLite database and stores the encryption key in the macOS keychain, under the name
'good_audible_story_sync_encryption_key'.

After signing into Audible, it will create a new device that you can see on your Amazon
[Installed on Devices](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/devicedetails?deviceFamily=AUDIBLE_APP)
page for Audible. This allows accessing your Audible library information, such as which books
you finished reading and when.

### Options

```sh
Usage: good-audible-story-sync [options]
    -d DATABASE_FILE,                Path to Sqlite database file. Defaults to good_audible_story_sync.db.
        --database-file
    -e EXPIRATION_DAYS,              Max number of days to use cached data, such as Audible library, before refreshing. Defaults to 1.
        --expiration-days
```

### Sample output

## How to develop

Built using Ruby version 3.3.6 on macOS.

```sh
bundle install
bin/good-audible-story-sync
```

Run `srb tc` to run the [Sorbet type checker](https://sorbet.org/).

You can also run `irb` to get an interactive Ruby console with some convenient methods available for debugging, including:

- #load_db_client
- #load_options
- #get_audible_auth
- #get_audible_client
- #get_audible_library
- #get_storygraph_auth
- #get_storygraph_client
- #get_goodreads_auth
- #get_goodreads_client

### Creating a tag

Update `VERSION` in [version.rb](./lib/good_audible_story_sync/version.rb).

```sh
git tag v0.0.x main # use the same version string as in `VERSION`
git push origin tag v0.0.x
```

This will trigger a workflow that builds the gem and creates a new release.

### Building the gem

```sh
gem build good_audible_story_sync.gemspec
```

This will create a file like project_pull_mover-0.0.1.gem which you can then install:

```sh
gem install good_audible_story_sync-0.0.1.gem
```

## Thanks

- [mkb79's Python Audible library](https://github.com/mkb79/Audible) for providing an example of how to authenticate with Audible and use its API, including the [unofficial API docs](https://audible.readthedocs.io/en/master/misc/external_api.html).
- [mechanize gem](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize) for letting me automate Storygraph and Goodreads even without an API.
